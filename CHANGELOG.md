## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-25

This release hardens the application helper layer. Every addition is additive,
so 1.3.x applications recompile unchanged apart from the fixes described under
Fixed and Security. The C ABI version moves to 1.4.0 with no structural change.

### Added

- Zero-allocation query parsing: `query.QueryParams` slices `?key=value`
  components out of the request target with SIMD byte scans into a fixed
  struct-of-arrays view (32 pairs) and never copies. `Request.query_params()`
  exposes it directly. `percent_decode` and `form_decode` materialize decoded
  values into caller-owned scratch buffers, so escapes stay borrowed until the
  application asks for them. More than 32 pairs fails closed with
  `error.TooManyQueryParameters`.
- `form` and `Request.form()` validate `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
  media types and parse the bounded request body with the same slicer.
- `status.StatusCode` and `status.line` provide canonical, typo-proof status
  lines. `errors.send`/`errors.send_buf` render typed JSON error documents
  (`{"error":{"code":...,"message":...}}`) with JSON escaping and no
  allocation, `errors.method_not_allowed` emits a validated `Allow` field, and
  `errors.internal` never echoes internal detail.
- `negotiate` parses `Accept` into a fixed 16-entry table with qvalue scoring
  (`score`, `accepts`, `best`); `Request.accepts(media_type)` is the request
  side entry point.
- `cache` provides deterministic strong ETags (`cache.etag`), If-None-Match
  matching over weak and list validators (`cache.is_not_modified`), and a 304
  sender (`cache.not_modified`).
- JSON schema validation now covers floats (`min_float`/`max_float`), arrays
  and non-u8 slices (`min_items`/`max_items`), whole-string and enum
  membership (`allowed`), and bounded nested validation (`max_nested_depth`).
  `IssueKind` gains typed JSON parse-failure kinds (syntax, unexpected
  end/token, invalid number, overflow, missing/duplicate/unknown field,
  invalid enum tag, length mismatch, item counts) instead of a blanket
  `malformed_json`.
- `cookie` gains a zero-copy `Iterator` over a `Cookie` field, versioned HMAC
  signing (`Key`, `sign_versioned`, `verify_versioned`) for key rotation,
  opt-in `__Host-`/`__Secure-` prefix enforcement through
  `Options.enforce_prefixes`, and pure RFC 9110 date formatting
  (`format_http_date`, `HttpDateBuffer`) with an `Options.expires_unix` field
  that emits `Expires` next to `Max-Age`.
- `Response.json_value` and `json_value_buf` provide named-type alternatives
  to the polymorphic `json`/`json_buf` for dynamic `std.json.Value` payloads.
- The OSS-Fuzz integration adds a fourth target, `query_parse`, with a
  deterministic `query_parse_smoke` executable, seed corpus, and runtime
  options. It fuzzes query slicing, percent/form decoding, and `Accept`
  negotiation, and asserts that every borrowed slice stays inside the parsed
  input. The Smith harness in `zig build test` runs the same code paths.
- `Response.begin_json` returns a `JsonStream` that coalesces JSON into a
  fixed stack buffer and writes chunked response parts, so arbitrarily large
  JSON costs no allocation. Use `stream.stringify()` with `std.json.Stringify`,
  `stream.write`/`write_chunk` for raw bytes with transport errors intact, and
  `stream.end()` to finish. Body size is bounded by the configured
  `with_write_queue_size` ring, not by a rendering buffer.
- `Response.begin_stream` pulls a chunked body from a `StreamProducer`
  callback as the transport drains. Producers park with `.pending` on
  `error.WouldBlock` and are re-invoked when output space frees, so a response
  body is not limited by the configured write queue. HTTP/1.1 resumes on write
  completion, HTTP/2 on write completion and WINDOW_UPDATE (window exhaustion
  is normalized to `WouldBlock`), and HTTP/3 on lsquic write drain. Targets
  without a producer callback fail closed with
  `error.ProducerStreamingUnsupported` before writing.
- Query capacity is no longer fixed at 32: `query.QueryParamsOf(capacity)`,
  `Request.query_params_of(capacity)`, and `form.parse_of(capacity, ...)`
  specialize the fixed pair table at compile time; the existing default names
  and overflow behavior are unchanged.

### Changed

- `Response.json_buf` and `Response.json` document their polymorphic contract
  (`std.json.Stringify`-compatible values); their behavior is unchanged.
- HTTP/1.1 response heads (status line, pending fields, explicit fields,
  terminator, body) are written as scatter parts instead of concatenating into
  a fixed buffer. Header size is now bounded by the per-connection write ring
  rather than roughly 4 KiB; HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 keep their own bounded metadata
  storage and limits.

### Fixed

- `errors.render` now writes `code` and `message` with a fixed-buffer JSON
  string encoder. Invalid UTF-8 previously reached `std.json`, which encoded a
  non-UTF-8 slice as a JSON number array, so the document no longer matched the
  documented `"code": "..."` shape. Invalid sequences now become U+FFFD and the
  document is always valid JSON for arbitrary bytes.
- Query components without `=` (`?flag`) now point at the segment end instead
  of a global empty literal, so every borrowed key and value slice lies inside
  the caller's buffer. The fuzz bounds assertions enforce this for empty values
  too.
- The Smith HTTP/query harness no longer reports empty flag values as an
  out-of-bounds failure; the stale `.zig-cache` crash artifact from that false
  positive was removed and the case is covered by
  `src/tests/query_tests.zig`.

### Security

- `Response.append_header` now rejects CR/LF inside a single value. The
  previous validation accepted an embedded `\r\n` as an additional
  well-formed field, so any singular-value helper forwarding untrusted data
  could split the response. Regression coverage lives in
  `src/tests/http_tests.zig`.
- JSON schema parse failures now report a typed `IssueKind` while still
  returning `error.MalformedJson`, so applications can distinguish a syntax
  error from a type mismatch without new allocation.
- Cookie `__Host-`/`__Secure-` prefix enforcement is available but off by
  default, so existing formatters keep their exact bytes until an application
  opts in.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-09-24

This release refreshes every pinned dependency. zslay moves to 0.2.1, lsquic
to 4.10.0, and BoringSSL and ls-hpack advance to their latest upstream
revisions; the lsquic overlay is regenerated against the new source. libxev,
ls-qpack, libdeflate, and zlib were already at their latest upstream refs.
The C ABI is unchanged; the Zig capability constant rename below is the only
source-level break.

### Added

- lsquic 4.10.0 exposes `lsquic_conn_get_full_peer_cert_chain()` and adds the
  `es_max_crypto_stash` engine setting that bounds how many out-of-order
  CRYPTO frames a connection stashes. `lsquic_engine_init_settings` now
  applies the upstream default of 20, so the bound is active without a source
  change.

### Changed

- Dependency: zslay 0.2.0 to 0.2.1 (`farbenbuilds/zslay`). The release changes
  only packaging and Nix metadata, so no call site moved.
- Dependency: BoringSSL `7c1efd8d6ffb36a57feba44e8c73cf674801f3cb` to
  `5fbad2285b096858fc9afa3e4c949fde39452070` (123 upstream commits). The build
  still reads `gen/sources.json`, so upstream added or removed translation
  units compile without a local source-list edit; no public symbol used by
  µWebZockets changed.
- Dependency: lsquic 4.9.3 (`19547405c24f60c4537478d38f4214e990be1f95`) to
  4.10.0 (`d5929af7cec6fd74f1cfea2cb1c07c27ce9102b1`).
  `patches/lsquic_h3_message_error.patch` applies unchanged to the new
  revision, `vendor/lsquic_overlay` was regenerated from the patched sources,
  and `lsquic_versions_to_string.c` names 4.10.0 with an unchanged version
  enum. `scripts/check_vendor_overlay.sh` passes.
- Dependency: ls-hpack `cf0f70dd10b352194c97448eb5d00b4aa484f531` to
  `38ceca78054d4175ba3f6411b1b83ac5c485e542`. Upstream treats over-long EOS
  padding as malformed and fixes a 32-bit fall-through warning; no call site
  moved.
- `http3_extensions.lsquic_4_9_3_capabilities` is renamed to
  `lsquic_4_10_0_capabilities` to track the pinned backend. Migration: replace
  the constant name; the value is unchanged (`.quic_datagrams = true`).
- libxev remains pinned to upstream `main`
  `9ce8e8e6ff89e583258a7f8e7adeeeaeae8611bf`, ls-qpack remains at
  `91567706c41c0d97ab8dc576873ecd472d7869fa`, libdeflate remains at
  `92e6a0db9fa848d742f9eb286c92afc60f2c3dda` (past the v1.26 tag), and zlib
  remains at 1.3.2. Upstream publishes no newer ref for any of them.
- `build.zig.zon.json`, `build.zig.zon.nix`, and `build.zig.zon.txt` were
  regenerated with zon2nix for the zslay 0.2.1 package hash, the BoringSSL and
  lsquic revisions, and the ls-hpack revision.
- Version metadata was bumped to 1.3.5 across `build.zig.zon`,
  `src/version.zig`, `flake.nix`, `include/uWebZockets.h`, the C and C++
  version tests, and the documentation headers.
- Documentation references were refreshed in `README.md`, `SKILL.md`,
  `CODEBASE.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and the WebSocket and TLS agent
  guides.

### Security

- ls-hpack rejects over-long EOS padding as malformed instead of accepting it
  as valid input.
- lsquic 4.10.0 bounds stashed out-of-order CRYPTO frames at 20 by default,
  limiting the memory a peer can force before the connection aborts.
- BoringSSL advances 123 commits, including the PKI `CertStatus` length check
  and the `X509_verify_cert` issuer-decoding fix.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-24

This release adds a terminal development log. It renders connection,
HTTP, and WebSocket events plus the bounded Prometheus counters as colored
lines from fixed stack buffers and writes every record through a thread-local
sink as soon as it is recorded, so the terminal stays real time without
allocating on the event loop. Wire behavior, capacities, and the C ABI are
unchanged.

### Added

- `src/observability/dev_log.zig` implements the allocation-free terminal log.
  `Sink` renders one record into a fixed 4096-byte buffer with comptime format
  strings and ANSI colors, writes it with a single bounded write as soon as it
  is recorded, and counts dropped lines. `thread_sink()` returns the sink owned
  by the calling thread, so recording needs no lock or atomic and the transport
  can reach it without threading a logger pointer through every callback.
- HTTP requests log Vite-style as `HH:MM:SS | [METHOD] /path : STATUS` with a
  dim clock, cyan method, and green, cyan, yellow, or red status by class. The
  exact `µWEBZOCKETS` wordmark from a Zig multiline string is written once at
  startup, followed by a Vite-style ready summary with the version, elapsed
  startup time, and local URL; a terminal
  narrower than the block art gets a one-line `µWebZockets` mark instead, and
  redirected output keeps the full wordmark.
- `src/observability/terminal.zig` probes the output width with a best-effort
  `ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ)` or Windows console query, so the wordmark adapts without
  allocating and without branching on the host OS in portable code.
- `src/observability/file_watch.zig` adds a file watcher:
  `with_watch_paths(&.{"src"})` streams `watch` lines for created, modified,
  and deleted files, so saves appear in the terminal as they happen. Linux
  reads inotify through the event loop for real-time changes; every other
  target scans the roots on a 500 ms loop timer. The watch set is bounded,
  skips build and VCS directories, requires `enable_dev_log`, and never
  allocates per event.
- `dev_log.Record` carries the wall clock, severity, and an explicit
  `Direction` (`data_in` or `data_out`) beside a named event payload
  (`connection_opened`, `connection_closed`, `http_request`, `ws_message`,
  `metric`), so no ambient logger state exists.
- `ServerConfig.enable_dev_log` defaults on, so every example shows the log
  when run in a terminal. The default stderr sink stays quiet when stderr is
  not a terminal, which keeps redirected runs and the throughput benchmark
  free of per-record writes; `App.set_dev_log_file` binds an output that always
  records. `App.flush_dev_log` and `App.log_metrics` expose any pending bytes
  and the counter snapshot, and setting the toggle false silences every
  development-log write.
- Every `zig build <example>` run in a terminal shows the wordmark, ready
  summary, request lines, and (with `with_watch_paths`) file changes.
- Unit coverage in `src/tests/dev_log_tests.zig` pins the rendered byte
  sequences, immediate write behavior, oversize drops, comptime metric names,
  and the thread-local sink identity.

### Changed

- `TcpConnection` now carries the thread-local dev-log sink and the optional
  counter registry, so the HTTP/1.1 and WebSocket paths emit records and
  advance counters without allocating. HTTP/2 dispatch and QUIC callbacks
  remain silent in this release.
- The `uwz_connections_accepted`, `uwz_connections_closed`,
  `uwz_http_requests`, and `uwz_ws_messages` counters now advance at their
  accept, close, dispatch, and complete-message sites when observability is
  enabled; they were previously defined but never incremented.
- `src/root.zig` exports `dev_log` for downstream consumers.

### Security

- No security-relevant behavior changed. The development log is opt-in,
  silent by default, writes only to the caller-bound file, and performs no
  dynamic allocation; parsing, validation, and wire behavior are unchanged.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-24

This release makes the repository a self-contained Zig package. Every C and
C++ dependency is compiled by Zig's own toolchain from pinned sources; the
public API, wire behavior, capacities, ownership semantics, C ABI, and
application logic are unchanged.

### Added

- Native dependency builders in `builds/vendor/`: `boringssl.zig`,
  `lsquic.zig`, `libdeflate.zig`, and `zlib.zig` compile the static vendor
  libraries with
  `zig cc` and `zig c++` instead of CMake, Ninja, Go, Perl, `patch`, or a
  system zlib. `builds/vendor/root.zig` links the resulting artifacts
  transitively.
- `vendor/lsquic_overlay/` holds the pre-generated
  `lsquic_versions_to_string.c` and the pre-patched `lsquic_qdec_hdl.{c,h}`
  and `lsquic_stream.c`, so the build no longer runs `gen-verstrs.pl` or
  applies `patches/lsquic_h3_message_error.patch` at build time. The patch
  remains the auditable source of the overlay.
- Bundled zlib 1.3.2 as a pinned package dependency for the RFC 7692 small
  windows and gQUIC certificate compression that libdeflate cannot express.
- `scripts/check_vendor_overlay.sh` verifies the overlay against the audit
  patch and the pinned lsquic version enum; the lint workflow runs it.
- `zig build clangd` writes a gitignored `compile_flags.txt` at the repository
  root with the fetched dependency include roots, so editors can analyze
  `src/c.h`, the lsquic shim, and the C ABI tests.

### Changed

- BoringSSL is compiled from the pinned package's `gen/sources.json` source
  lists, with the committed `gen/crypto/err_data.cc` and perlasm sources used
  as shipped upstream. Windows and MemorySanitizer builds disable assembly
  exactly as upstream does.
- ls-qpack and ls-hpack remain pinned package dependencies compiled as one
  translation unit each; neither has a generation step, architecture-specific
  source, or system tool requirement.
- libdeflate keeps its runtime dispatch: the AVX-512 and VPCLMULQDQ paths are
  disabled because the bundled Clang requires the explicit `evex512` target
  feature, and dispatch falls back to AVX2 and SSSE3.
- Vendor C and C++ is compiled with explicit upstream-compatible flags.
  Zig's release modes are stopped from injecting undefined-behavior traps,
  `_FORTIFY_SOURCE`, and stack protectors into third-party code: lsquic's
  packet-header path tripped an injected `ud1` trap in the HTTP/3 server, and
  the fortified wrappers also hide zeroed buffers from MemorySanitizer. The
  sanitizer modes still enable their own reporting checks afterwards.
- `build.zig.zon` adds the zlib dependency; `build.zig.zon.json`,
  `build.zig.zon.nix`, and `build.zig.zon.txt` were regenerated.
- The `vendor/boringssl`, `vendor/lsquic`, and `vendor/libdeflate` audit
  submodules were removed. Only the `vendor/h1spec` compliance submodule and
  the `vendor/lsquic_overlay` build input remain; vendor license texts live in
  `licenses/vendor/`, and `scripts/check_vendor_overlay.sh` fetches the pinned
  lsquic package instead of reading a local checkout.
- `flake.nix` provides Zig plus development tooling only. CI caches Zig's
  content-addressed package and local caches instead of the CMake/Ninja
  vendor trees, and the timestamp-refresh workaround is gone.
- Removed the `-Dzlib-prefix` option, the `UWEBZOCKETS_ZLIB_PREFIX`
  environment variable, the Windows vcpkg zlib bootstrap under
  `scripts/windows`, `scripts/prepare_lsquic_source.sh`, and the `zig-cc` and
  `zig-c++` compiler wrappers.
- Release archives include the bundled zlib license next to the other
  third-party notices.

### Security

- No security-relevant behavior changed. Dependency revisions, compiler
  flags, sanitizer instrumentation, and validation bounds are unchanged; the
  packaged libraries are built from the same pinned sources as before.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-09-23

This release is a type-readability pass. Wire behavior, capacities, ownership
semantics, exported names, and field layouts are unchanged.

### Added

- Named callback aliases on the public surface: `Http3EndFn`, `Http3BeginFn`,
  `Http3WriteFn`, `Http3FinishFn`, `Http2EndFn`, `Http2BeginFn`,
  `Http2WriteFn`, `Http2FinishFn`, `AsyncCompleteFn`, and `AsyncWakeFn` in
  `Response`; `WsUpgradeCallback`, `WsOpenCallback`, `WsMessageCallback`,
  `WsDrainCallback`, and `WsCloseCallback` in `WsBehavior`; `CloseCallback`
  and `TickCallback` in the transport; `ReadableReadFn`, `ReadableCloseFn`,
  `WritableWriteFn`, `WritableCloseFn`, and `WritableBackpressureFn` in
  `streams`; `WriteFn`, `RequestFn`, `WsDataFn`, and `StreamClosedFn` in the
  HTTP/2 server session.
- Named HTTP/2 event payloads extracted from the `Event` union:
  `DiscardedDataEvent`, `StreamResetEvent`, `GoAwayEvent`, and
  `WindowUpdateEvent`.
- Explicit `ServerConfig.Overrides` record for `ServerConfig.with`, replacing
  the reflection-driven `anytype` parameter with 13 documented optional
  fields.
- Named route payloads (`ContextualRoute`, `ContextualAsyncRoute`), a named
  `SocketFd` for the transport descriptor helpers, named C ABI trampoline
  tables, and protocol-bound aliases such as `ControlFrameBuffer` and
  `AcceptTokenBuffer`.

### Changed

- `ServerConfig.with` now accepts `ServerConfig.Overrides`. Anonymous struct
  literals (`.with(.{ .max_body_size = 256 * 1024 })`) coerce unchanged;
  passing a full `ServerConfig` value as the override argument is no longer
  accepted.
- `close_socket`, `request_quickack`, and `apply_listener_tuning` take the
  named `SocketFd` instead of `anytype`, and the now-redundant runtime type
  probe in `close_socket` is gone.
- `register_typed_context` validates its context pointer through the named
  `mutable_context_pointer` comptime helper.
- Documentation records the mandatory type-readability contract in
  `CODING_CONVENTION.md` section 8 and mirrors it in `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `SKILL.md`, `CODEBASE.md`, and `CONTRIBUTE.md`; `docs/callback_lifecycle.md`
  source references were re-synchronized with the tree.

### Security

- No security-relevant behavior changed. Recovery paths, validation bounds,
  and C ABI layouts are identical to 1.1.7.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-09-23

This release tracks the zslay 0.2.0 frame-parser surface. Wire behavior,
capacities, and ownership semantics are unchanged.

### Added

- Adopted the zslay 0.2.0 pure close-payload validator
  (`zslay.validate_close_payload`) in `src/ws/socket.zig`, so close codes and
  UTF-8 reasons share one validation source with the frame parser instead of a
  local duplicate scanner.

### Changed

- Dependency: zslay 0.1.9 to 0.2.0 (`farbenbuilds/zslay`). The release adds the
  pure `validate_close_payload` helper and the `1012`, `1013`, and `1014` close
  status codes, fixes `Conn.get_tx_header_buffer` to return a slice into the
  queued node instead of a local copy (removing a use-after-return) with an
  empty TX queue now yielding an empty slice, and adds the additive
  `zslay_conn_reset` C export. No existing zslay call site changes shape.
- `build.zig.zon.json`, `build.zig.zon.nix`, and `build.zig.zon.txt` were
  updated for the v0.2.0 package hash and URL.
- Version metadata was bumped to 1.1.7 across `build.zig.zon`,
  `src/version.zig`, `flake.nix`, `include/uWebZockets.h`, the C and C++
  version tests, and the documentation headers.
- Documentation references to zslay were refreshed in `README.md`, `SKILL.md`,
  `CODEBASE.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and the WebSocket agent guide.

### Security

- Close-frame validation delegates to zslay 0.2.0: one-byte payloads and
  reserved close codes return `error.ProtocolError`, invalid UTF-8 reasons
  return `error.InvalidUtf8`, and µWebZockets keeps its 125-byte control-frame
  bound on top of the pure validator.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-09-22

This release tracks the zslay 0.1.9 frame-parser surface and confirms libxev is
already at the latest upstream revision. Wire behavior, capacities, and
ownership semantics are unchanged.

### Added

- Adopted the zslay 0.1.9 named wire constants `zslay.MaxFrameHeaderLen` and
  `zslay.FrameHeaderBuffer` in the WebSocket tests, replacing the local 14-byte
  header literals.
- `zslay.ConnConfig` is now named explicitly where the server WebSocket
  context is constructed in `src/ws/socket.zig`.

### Changed

- Dependency: zslay 0.1.5 to 0.1.9 (`farbenbuilds/zslay`). The release renames
  `DecodedHeader.extended_len` and `DecodedHeader.header_size` to `payload_len`
  and `header_len`, moves `FrameNode` to the module root with `header_len`,
  `header_sent`, and `payload_sent` fields, and replaces the loose
  fragmentation fields with `rx_fragment` and `tx_fragment`. `src/ws/socket.zig`,
  `src/tests/ws_tests.zig`, and `src/tests/fuzz_main.zig` follow the new names.
- `build.zig.zon.json`, `build.zig.zon.nix`, and `build.zig.zon.txt` were
  regenerated with zon2nix for the new package hash.
- libxev remains pinned to upstream `main`
  `9ce8e8e6ff89e583258a7f8e7adeeeaeae8611bf`. Upstream publishes no newer tag,
  release, or commit, so no pin change was required.
- Documentation references zslay 0.1.9 in `README.md`, `SKILL.md`,
  `CODEBASE.md`, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. `SECURITY.md` tracks the `1.1.x`
  line as the supported release, and the WebSocket, transport, router, and TLS
  agent guidance was corrected to match the current code (zslay pin, 0-RTT
  policy, lock-free cluster ring, and current `file:line` references).

### Security

- No security-relevant behavior changed. Frame validation, masking, and message
  limits stay enforced by µWebZockets; zslay 0.1.9 adds no new live protocol
  path to the server.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-22

This release tightens the functional-purity contract across the library and
makes it machine-checked. No wire behavior, capacity, or ownership semantics
change.

### Added

- Named HTTP/2 frame event payload types (`HeadersEvent`,
  `HeadersContinuationEvent`, `DiscardedHeadersEvent`, `DataEvent`) in
  `src/http2/connection.zig`.
- `CODING_CONVENTION.md` section 7, the mandatory functional-purity and
  anti-slop contract: no OOP or hidden state, pure transformations, explicit
  types over `anytype` at module boundaries, scoped logging instead of console
  output, no dead code or TODO markers, three-level control-flow limit, no
  forwarding wrappers, and error-discipline rules.
- `AGENTS.md` Code Hygiene section so agents apply the same contract and run
  the format, convention, release, and test gates.
- `scripts/check_conventions.sh` now rejects `std.debug.print` and direct
  stdout/stderr writes in `src/`, plus `TODO`, `FIXME`, `XXX`, and `HACK`
  markers in the Zig sources.

### Changed

- `src/http2/server.zig` frame handlers take the named event payload types
  instead of `anytype`, so every payload shape is checked at compile time.
- Transport and TLS diagnostics in `src/core/tcp.zig`, `src/core/udp.zig`,
  `src/core/timer.zig`, `src/router/app.zig`, and `src/crypto/handshake.zig`
  use `std.log.scoped` at the matching severity; the listening messages are
  `info`, recoverable I/O failures are `warn`, and cancellation noise is
  `debug`.
- Removed unused imports in `src/router/app.zig`, `src/http/streams.zig`,
  `src/ws/stream.zig`, and `fuzz/http_framing.zig`.
- `CONTRIBUTE.md` and `SKILL.md` point contributors and agents at the section 7
  contract.

### Security

- No security-relevant behavior changed; diagnostics no longer write directly
  to stderr, so host logging policy applies to every transport error.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-19

This release adds the unreliable low-latency datagram surface, an opportunistic
AF_XDP transport, and continuous kernel-level observability. Every new hot path
draws from the one startup slab and performs no heap allocation.

### Added

- WebTransport datagram routing in the server builder.
  `Server.builder(...).with_webtransport_datagrams(max_size, slots)` reserves
  the capacity and applications register session paths with `App.datagram` or
  `App.datagram_context`, mirroring the HTTP route surface. One `DatagramRing`
  per connection is carved from the startup slab as parallel metadata arrays
  plus a fixed-stride payload region, so enqueue and drain never allocate; a
  full ring drops without blocking the transport and increments
  `datagrams_dropped`. `App.dispatch_datagram` is the HTTP/3 DATAGRAM boundary
  and `App.next_datagram` drains a connection's queued copies.
- `src/quic/datagram_ring.zig`, a bounded SoA FIFO over caller storage with
  wrapping u32 cursors, drop-oldest support, and a lifetime drop counter.
- `Preset.webtransport_realtime` reserves 1200-byte datagrams at depth 64 for
  512 connections and enables the metrics endpoint.
- Opt-in AF_XDP kernel bypass. `Preset.kernel_bypass` and
  `with_kernel_bypass(true)` request the zero-copy path. `resolve_mode` removes
  the request at compile time on non-Linux targets, and the runtime probe falls
  back to the standard stack when the kernel or process privileges refuse
  AF_XDP while recording the reason in `transport_availability`. The UMEM
  region is page aligned inside the same startup slab as the connection pools,
  and `src/xdp/transport.zig` owns the rings with a fixed free-frame stack so
  frame recycling never allocates.
- `src/xdp/socket.zig` now maps the TX ring, validates descriptor bounds, and
  exposes `receive_frame`, `release_frame`, `transmit_frame`, and `reclaim_tx`.
- Continuous eBPF observability. `src/observability/metrics.zig` renders a
  fixed-capacity counter registry and an optional kernel latency histogram into
  Prometheus text through one `std.Io.Writer.fixed` cursor, so formatting never
  allocates. The hidden `/metrics` route (configurable with `with_metrics_path`)
  serves it from a fixed stack buffer and folds in the pinned `uwz_latency`
  per-CPU histogram through `src/observability/ebpf.zig`.
- `src/observability/uwz_latency_bpf.c` and the extended `zig build ebpf` step
  build the XDP redirect and latency histogram objects from one pipeline.
- `with_observability(true)` carves a cache-line-aligned registry in the
  startup slab; `observability`, `ebpf`, `xdp_transport`, `datagram`, and
  `datagram_ring` are exported from the package root.

### Changed

- `ServerConfig` gains `transport`, `max_datagram_size`, `datagram_slots`,
  `xdp_frame_size`, `xdp_frame_count`, `observability`, and `metrics_path`.
  `required_alignment` reports the page alignment the bypass layout needs;
  `init_configured` allocates with it and `init_from_slab` rejects misaligned
  storage with `error.MisalignedSlab`.
- The centralized test module re-exports the new modules through
  `test_support`, so the suite runs without relative imports outside the module
  root.
- `src/version.zig` is now the single Zig source of truth for the release
  version; `build.zig` derives its `std.SemanticVersion` from it, and the C ABI
  and OpenAPI defaults read the same module. `scripts/bump_version.sh` rewrites
  the manifest, C ABI macros, C/C++ version assertions, documentation headers,
  and the changelog skeleton in one command, and
  `scripts/check_release_version.sh` fails lint CI when any copy drifts.

### Security

- AF_XDP remains a request, never an assumption: probe and ring failures cannot
  fail startup and always leave the standard transport serving traffic.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-09-18

This release supersedes the unreleased 1.0.7 and 1.0.8 lines: their planned
transport and protocol work ships here together with the zero-copy, 0-RTT, and
BBR boundaries.

### Added

- Zero-copy static file streaming. `Response.send_file` and
  `TcpConnection.begin_file_response` hand an open regular file to the kernel
  with `sendfile` on Linux and macOS, so body bytes never cross a user-space
  buffer and large assets are no longer capped by the per-route file buffer.
  The connection takes ownership of the descriptor on success, serves RFC 9110
  byte ranges with an exact `Content-Length`, answers HEAD without streaming,
  and closes the descriptor when the body drains or the peer disappears.
- `src/core/zero_copy.zig` with the per-platform kernel transfer boundary.
  libxev sockets are blocking (io_uring creates them without `O_NONBLOCK` and
  Linux does not inherit the flag through `accept`), and a blocking `sendfile`
  sleeps until its full count is transferred, so the transport opens a
  temporary nonblocking window for the transfer and closes it before queueing
  any completion. Bytes that `EAGAIN` fall back to a bounded dribble that
  reuses the idle TLS staging buffer, and one tick transfers at most four
  kernel chunks. Windows keeps the bounded buffered path because libxev owns
  the IOCP completion port, so an overlapped `TransmitFile` cannot be observed
  by the event loop without stalling a worker.
- HTTP/1 dispatch now suspends pipelined request processing while a kernel file
  body is in flight, so a later response can never interleave with it.
- TLS 1.3 0-RTT (early data) on the HTTPS context via BoringSSL
  `SSL_CTX_set_early_data_enabled`. Early data is replayable, so only safe
  methods (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`) are dispatched before the handshake is
  confirmed; anything else receives `425 Too Early`. The HTTP/1.1 rejection
  also closes the connection, while HTTP/2 rejects the individual stream.
  Rejected early data is never dispatched: BoringSSL drops it and completes the
  full handshake in place, so no reset path is needed on the server.
- QUIC BBR congestion control. The lsquic engine now pins `es_cc_algo` to BBRv1
  and enables per-connection pacing explicitly, replacing lsquic's adaptive
  default that falls back to CUBIC at low RTT.
- Regression coverage for the kernel sendfile path and the BBR engine policy.

### Changed

- `static_files` parses the request range before touching the file body, then
  attempts the kernel path and only falls back to the bounded buffer for TLS,
  HTTP/2, HTTP/3, and oversized assets.
- `TlsContext.init_with_alpn` takes an explicit early-data policy; the HTTP/3
  context keeps 0-RTT disabled until lsquic replay protection is defined end to
  end.

### Security

- 0-RTT admits safe, idempotent methods only on both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. The
  HTTP/1.1 rejection closes the connection so a replayed request cannot be
  retried as-is on the same connection.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Added `ServerConfig`, named `Presets` (`microservice`, `websocket_chat`,
  `file_server`), and the fluent `Server.builder` API with compile-time
  `with_*` overrides that translate named limits into one contiguous startup
  slab.
- Added `Server.builder(...).build(allocator)`, `App.init_configured`, and
  `App.init_from_slab`, which carve the connection pool, HTTP/1.1 request
  buffers, WebSocket message regions, response write queues, and optional
  RFC 7692 scratch from a single block.
- Added structured JSON transport rejections: oversized bodies return `413`
  and oversized headers return `431` with a document naming the configured
  limit and the `ServerConfig` field to raise.
- Added `examples/basic_microservice.zig` and `examples/custom_builder.zig`
  with matching `zig build` steps.
- Added physical-core affinity and shared-nothing startup options:
  `App.cluster(...).init_with_options`, `Server.builder(...).build_cluster`, and
  `ClusterOptions` pin worker `i` to the `i`-th allowed physical core on Linux
  and Windows while keeping restricted cpusets and affinity-less platforms
  running unpinned.
- Added listener and connection tuning: `SO_REUSEPORT` on POSIX,
  `TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT` on listeners, and a one-shot `TCP_QUICKACK` request at
  accept so the hot read path stays syscall-free.
- Added a lock-free Vyukov sequence ring for cluster inboxes, removing the
  spinlock from the cross-worker wakeup path and cache-line separating the
  producer and consumer positions.
- Added `examples/shared_nothing_cluster.zig` plus the restructured
  `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/memory_model.md`, `docs/protocols.md`, and
  `docs/operations.md`.

### Changed

- Moved per-connection HTTP/1.1 request buffers out of `TcpConnection` into
  the application slab; the parser now enforces a per-connection
  `max_body_size` policy instead of the fixed module default.
- `freelist_pool` can adopt caller-owned storage through `from_slices` and
  leaves that storage intact in `deinit`.
- `App.init` keeps its existing signature and now builds the same single slab
  through `init_configured`.
- Windows cluster listeners fall back to `SO_REUSEADDR` and thread affinity to
  `SetThreadAffinityMask` instead of failing when `SO_REUSEPORT` is missing.
- Rewrote `README.md` as a short onboarding document and moved deep runtime,
  memory, protocol, and operations material into `docs/`.
- Normalized naming to the coding convention: the JSON-RPC standard-error
  namespace is now `StandardError` and the internal builder type generator is
  `configured_builder`. The convention checker now also rejects PascalCase
  function names, snake_case type names, and camelCase fields or parameters.

### Fixed

- Fixed an HTTP/2 stream-lifecycle race: an `END_STREAM` HEADERS frame no
  longer releases its slab slot before the server finishes processing the
  event, the server refuses to emit `RST_STREAM` on stream 0, and a second
  HEADERS section on a stream without a completed request is rejected as an
  unexpected trailer.
- Enforced `ServerConfig.max_body_size` for HTTP/2 request bodies, both
  declared and streamed, within the compiled session slab capacity.
- Fixed macOS/kqueue connection-slot and QUIC-drain leaks: canceled read and
  write callbacks that the backend can drop no longer gate slab release, and
  the close completion clears the outstanding flags.
- Fixed a shutdown hang where stopping a timer or the idle sweeper from inside
  its own tick callback re-armed it forever.
- Fixed QUIC shutdown re-entrancy: `shutdown()` from an HTTP/3 handler now
  defers `lsquic_engine_cooldown` until the active engine callback unwinds.
- Fixed WebSocket fatal-error handling: a failed parser is terminal, a close
  frame completes the frame parser instead of being re-emitted, HTTP/2 tunnels
  are reset on failure or close, and large sends split across DATA frames
  instead of committing a frame header before a rejected payload.
- Fixed an absolute-path escape in static file index appending and made static
  file traversal open every directory component without following symlinks.
- Fixed JSON-RPC perfect-hash dispatch to confirm stored method bytes after a
  fingerprint match, and widened the router's copied-path registry offset so
  filling the 64 KiB limit cannot overflow.
- Fixed slab-plan alignment so near-maximum layouts return
  `error.SlabSizeOverflow` instead of panicking, and rejected `ServerConfig`
  capacities that do not match the generated `App` type at compile time.
- Fixed `If-None-Match` precedence over `If-Modified-Since`, OpenAPI literal
  `:`/`*` path segments, `Cluster.deinit` double-call safety, the TLS plaintext
  drain continuing after close was scheduled, and the native stream adapter's
  zslay opcode names.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Added native, `wasm32-freestanding`, `wasm32-wasi`, and Linux eBPF build
  targets behind a thin root orchestrator and decomposed the CMake/Ninja,
  sanitizer, test, fuzz, example, and target logic under `builds/`.
- Added a transport-independent protocol core, a pull-based `WebSocketStream`,
  WHATWG-style BYOB reads, and an immutable backpressure transition function.
- Added bounded libdeflate compression streams, BoringSSL SHA-256, HMAC-SHA256,
  and AES-GCM primitives, plus generation-safe cooperative cancellation for
  streams, RPC dispatch, timers, and pooled TCP connection lifecycles.
- Added generation-checked shared memory with a bounded Cap'n Proto envelope
  for zero-copy WASM host views.
- Added a Linux AF_XDP socket with UMEM ownership rings and an XDP redirect
  program, plus kTLS configuration and zero-copy `sendfile`/`splice` helpers.
- Added SIMD HTTP delimiter and field-value scanning and compile-time JSON-RPC
  perfect-hash services with constant-time table lookup.

### Security

- Reject stale shared-memory and cancellation handles across owner reuse, clear
  released FFI blocks, authenticate AES-GCM before exposing plaintext, and use
  constant-time HMAC verification.
- Retained strict bounded HTTP framing, conflicting transfer-length rejection,
  header control-character rejection, idle connection expiry, and allocator
  lifecycle leak checks.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Added fixed-capacity JSON-RPC 2.0 services with bounded method ownership,
  open-addressed dispatch, typed procedure adapters and results, context
  handlers, notifications, batches, standard protocol errors, application
  faults, and `App.rpc` HTTP mounting.

### Fixed

- Validate complete JSON-RPC batches before invoking procedures so malformed
  tails cannot commit prefix side effects behind a parse-error response.
- Retry transient connection resets in Autobahn readiness probes between
  isolated compliance batches.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Added bounded static asset serving with MIME detection, ETags,
  Last-Modified validation, cache control, single byte ranges, and
  traversal-safe directory-relative file access.
- Added zero-allocation multipart form parsing with borrowed chunk iteration,
  signed cookie/session helpers, CORS and security-header middleware,
  reflected JSON constraints, Server-Sent Events, and OpenAPI 3.1 route output.
- Added a native thread-per-core cluster manager with fixed cross-thread
  message queues, event-loop wakeups, shared pub/sub fan-out, and reusable
  listener ports.
- Added configurable WebSocket ping intervals and pong timeouts using the
  existing data-oriented connection sweep.
- Added portable SIMD delimiter search with scalar tail handling for multipart
  parsing.

### Fixed

- Kept Git tags in v<version> form while publishing GitHub release titles as
  uWebZockets v<version> on both release creation and later edits.
- Assigned Windows build deployments to the separate Windows Publishing
  environment.
- Rejected multipart boundary-prefix sequences that are not complete delimiter
  lines.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Added Windows target support (`x86_64-windows-gnu` / MinGW ABI) using Windows
  IOCP non-blocking I/O through `libxev`.
- Added Windows socket abstraction (`core_tcp.close_socket`, `c.closesocket`
  vs `close`, `lsquic_api` `WSASendTo` scatter-gather batch packet sending, and
  `mswsock` extension).
- Added Windows ABI compatibility for `uz_lsxpack_header` in C shims, accounting
  for 4-byte enum bitfield alignment.
- Added native Windows CI that compiles the `x86_64-windows-gnu` test graph and
  static libraries, plus a Windows archive in tagged GitHub releases.
- Added Fetch-inspired ergonomics to `Request` (`headers` view,
  `text()`, `bytes()`, `json()`, `url()`) and `Response` (`text()`, `html()`,
  `bytes()`, `json()`, `json_buf()`, `redirect()`, `writable_stream()`).
- Added Streams-inspired adapters (`ReadableByteStream` with BYOB and chunk
  readers, `WritableByteStream`, and `pipe_to`).
- Added optional borrowed fallback parameter and header slices for external
  request adapters while retaining fixed-capacity built-in parsers.
- Added RFC 8441 extended CONNECT support for WebSocket upgrade over HTTP/2
  streams (`SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL`), mapping frames across stream DATA
  payloads.

### Fixed

- Isolated Autobahn compression datasets in fresh containers, merged their full
  results before gating, and retried a killed batch once with a fresh server.
- Grouped Windows compiler wrappers under `scripts/windows`.
- Made `tests/c_api/smoke.c` cross-platform for Windows and POSIX with
  `WSAStartup`/`WSACleanup`, `SOCKET` abstraction, `close_socket()`, and `send()`.
- Centralized release metadata validation so the package, Nix, C ABI, tests,
  changelog, and documentation cannot silently disagree about the version.
- Guarded host `zlib_prefix` in `build.zig` to only apply to native targets,
  preventing host ELF static archives from interfering with Windows cross-compilation.
- Rejected CR/LF in redirect destinations before formatting the `Location`
  field.
- Bound header-view iteration and byte-stream callback counts to their borrowed
  slices, and close both stream adapters after transfer failures.
- Bound HTTP/2 WebSocket state to one active tunnel per connection, removed
  stale pub/sub state on every teardown path, and rejected DATA for unaccepted
  extended CONNECT streams.
- Deferred terminal HTTP/2 DATA stream release until event processing finishes,
  preventing one stream from closing its multiplexed connection.
- Mapped Winsock send errors to the C errno values expected by lsquic and used
  `closesocket` for Windows transport sockets.
- Kept HTTP/3 extended CONNECT and WebTransport helpers detached from the live
  listener until backend negotiation and application policy can be enforced.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Fixed macOS release builds by routing TCP, UDP, and listener cancellation
  through a kqueue-compatible libxev adapter.
- Fixed Nix dev-shell evaluation by using the package set supplied by
  `flake-parts` instead of recursively replacing its compiler stdenv.
- Fixed macOS release metadata validation by replacing the Bash 4-only
  `mapfile` builtin with Bash 3.2-compatible version parsing.
- Removed Deno from the Nix dev shell and made `zon2nix` conditional on
  platform support, preventing unnecessary `rusty-v8`/glibc builds and
  unsupported Darwin shell evaluation.
- Kept host utilities native in the musl dev shell so `direnv` does not
  rebuild target-libc copies of unrelated development tools.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Added bounded `ConfiguredApp` storage for per-connection WebSocket messages
  and output queues.
- Added method-aware HTTP routes for GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH,
  OPTIONS, and fallback handlers.
- Added query/path separation, duplicate-header inspection, HEAD fallback,
  automatic OPTIONS and `Allow`, `100 Continue`, and chunked responses.
- Added WebSocket upgrade authorization, frame/message limits, close handling,
  drain notification, buffered-byte reporting, streaming UTF-8 validation, and
  SIMD masking.
- Added RFC 7692 per-message deflate with strict offer parsing, mandatory
  client/server no-context-takeover, 9-15 bit server and 8-15 bit client window
  negotiation, bounded decompression, and startup-allocated per-connection
  scratch storage.
- Added HTTPS with BoringSSL TLS 1.3 and `h2`/`http/1.1` ALPN.
- Added a bounded HTTP/2 connection state machine with a fixed-capacity
  structure-of-arrays stream slab, strict frame sequencing, settings and
  flow-control validation, and caller-owned HPACK dynamic-table, Huffman,
  request-decoding, and response-encoding storage. Integrated eight-stream
  routing into plaintext prior-knowledge and TLS ALPN listeners.
- Added a bounded HTTP/3 server adapter over lsquic with direct QPACK-to-Request
  decoding, structured response headers, fixed stream/header/packet pools,
  partial-write handling, and shared HTTP route dispatch.
- Added `ConfiguredAppWithTimeout`, a 120-second default idle policy, and the
  option to disable idle sweeping with a zero timeout.
- Added exact and parameterized routing. `:name` captures one nonempty segment,
  terminal `*name` captures the remaining path including an empty remainder,
  and every request stores at most 16 borrowed captures without allocation.
- Added 32-entry ordered middleware, context-aware handlers, and generation-
  checked one-shot asynchronous response tokens for Zig applications.
- Added a versioned C ABI with opaque application, request, response, and
  WebSocket handles, predictable integer errors, explicit shutdown/destroy,
  synchronous and one-shot asynchronous routes, ordered middleware, borrowed
  route parameters, and the installed `include/uWebZockets.h` header.
- Added RFC 10008 `QUERY` routing and mandatory media-type validation to the
  Zig and C APIs while preserving the stable numeric value of `ANY`.
- Added HTTP/3 helpers for RFC 9220 extended CONNECT validation, bounded server
  push bookkeeping, and explicit early-data policy. Added bounded
  WebTransport-over-HTTP/3 draft-16 settings, CONNECT, session, stream,
  datagram, capsule, flow-control, and error-mapping primitives.
- Added Autobahn and h1spec compliance servers and GitHub Actions workflows,
  including a Deno-orchestrated Autobahn runner with deterministic cleanup and
  report gating.
- Added bounded HTTP, HTTP/3 metadata, zslay, and WebSocket extension fuzz
  coverage. Added Google OSS-Fuzz/libFuzzer entrypoints for HTTP framing,
  WebSocket masking, and QUIC/WebTransport packet boundaries, with seed
  corpora, dictionaries, and deterministic local smoke targets.
- Added a pinned curl/ngtcp2 and aioquic HTTP/3 interoperability gate, including
  a valid trailing field section plus duplicate pseudo-header, pseudo-header
  ordering, and connection-specific header rejection probes. Malformed and
  healthy sibling streams share one connection, require `H3_MESSAGE_ERROR`,
  and retain qlog evidence.
- Added the versioned `http-throughput-v1` regression contract, pull-request
  comparison gate, and append-only benchmark history publication.
- Added Nix native/musl packages, six-target publishing, checksums, deployment
  environments, and third-party license packaging.
- Added native-Linux ASan, UBSan, LeakSanitizer, and Zig C-UB test mode for the
  Zig/C/C++ graph, with an isolated sanitizer vendor cache.
- Added a mutually exclusive native x86_64 Linux MemorySanitizer mode with
  origin tracking, full pinned C/C++ instrumentation, an isolated cache, and
  a dedicated CI run.

### Changed

- Updated zslay from 0.1.1 to 0.1.5 using the immutable v0.1.5 source archive.
- Migrated WebSocket parsing to zslay 0.1.5's role, frame-node, length-limit,
  and error APIs.
- Reworked connection ownership into a contiguous slab with an activity bitmap
  and deterministic release.
- Reworked application shutdown into an idempotent completion-driven drain;
  new work is rejected before accept, TCP, timer, UDP, and QUIC resources are
  stopped and released in ownership order.
- Extracted the UDP/QUIC socket lifecycle into `src/core/udp.zig`; its fixed receive
  buffer, read, timer, cancellation, close, and drain completions are owned by
  one transport and used by `App.listen_udp`.
- Reworked routing as fixed-capacity parallel arrays and made duplicate,
  invalid, or excessive routes return errors. Route mutation is locked after
  either listener starts.
- Centralized ordinary Zig unit tests under `src/tests/`, with
  `src/tests/main.zig` as the `zig build test` root. Its
  `src/tests/fuzz_main.zig` Smith harness also serves as the dedicated
  `zig build fuzz` root.
- Reworked TCP and TLS writes to preserve partial writes in bounded queues and
  signal backpressure.
- Reworked pub/sub to own bounded topic names and remove stale subscribers.
- Mapped Zig optimization modes and target triples into isolated CMake/Ninja
  builds for BoringSSL, lsquic, and libdeflate.
- Moved BoringSSL, lsquic, ls-qpack, ls-hpack, and libdeflate source selection
  to immutable Zig package URLs and hashes so downstream path dependencies do
  not depend on the repository's vendor submodules.
- Added a downstream path-dependency compile fixture and installed
  `uWebZockets.h` through both the normal install and library-only steps.
- Pinned Nixpkgs 26.05 so GNU/Linux, musl/Linux, Apple Silicon macOS, and Intel
  macOS release outputs evaluate from one flake.
- Pinned the Autobahn image by digest and used Deno's native process API so the
  compliance runner has no runtime JavaScript dependency graph.
- Run the Autobahn container with the invoking POSIX UID/GID so generated
  reports remain replaceable across repeated local runs.
- Disabled BoringSSL's unused test/benchmark targets in the embedded build and
  passed the selected Ninja executable directly to every CMake configure.

### Fixed

- Fixed connection-pool initialization, double release, stale-slot reuse, and
  inactive-slot sweeping defects. Pool reuse now waits for outstanding read,
  write, and close completions.
- Fixed application teardown leaks across sockets, TLS objects, timers,
  message storage, write storage, and pub/sub state.
- Fixed a high-severity use-after-free where application teardown could free
  the connection slab, timers, event loop, and I/O buffers while libxev
  completions still retained pointers into them.
- Fixed a recurring io_uring timer rearm that reused an expired absolute
  deadline and could spin a CPU core.
- Fixed benchmark candidate and baseline builds running from the parent
  workspace where Zig could not discover either checkout's `build.zig`.
- Fixed drained TCP write rings retaining a tail offset that split later small
  responses across the wrap boundary and triggered delayed-ACK stalls.
- Added bounded benchmark build retries for transient immutable dependency
  fetch failures.
- Fixed HTTP request accumulation, pipelining, partial writes, close-after-drain,
  duplicate framing headers, oversized metadata/body handling, and response
  header injection. Empty header names, invalid chunk-size grammar, oversized
  trailers, invalid response statuses, and bodies on 204/304 are rejected.
- Fixed WebSocket masking, fragmented empty-final frames, fragmented large
  messages, invalid UTF-8 across frame boundaries, invalid close payloads,
  unbounded writes, and masked server output.
- Fixed plaintext handling in HTTPS mode and bounded the TLS BIO pair.
- Rejected sockets now close immediately before any I/O registration, avoiding
  completion-storage exhaustion.
- Removed the per-connection chunk scratch buffer and its 8 KiB chunk ceiling;
  chunk parts now enter the bounded output ring directly.
- Fixed outbound WebSocket UTF-8, control-length, close-code, and close-reason
  validation, including the RFC 6455 distinction between protocol errors and
  invalid UTF-8 close reasons.
- Fixed compressed fragmented messages, RSV1 validation, malformed extension
  alternatives, compressed expansion bombs, and negotiated small-window
  server output.
- Separated inbound and outbound compression scratch so a drain callback or
  pub/sub send cannot overwrite a fragmented compressed message in progress.
- Closed TCP descriptors when listener binding or activation fails.
- Fixed HTTP/3 header ordering, duplicate pseudo-headers and content lengths,
  URI target and authority validation, connection-specific metadata,
  request-body and trailer framing, bounded response buffering, packet
  ownership, global lsquic initialization lifetime, and an lsquic boundary
  defect that promoted application header errors to connection aborts.

### Security

- Added strict WebSocket handshake validation for method, upgrade tokens,
  version, unique key headers, and optional application authorization.
- Added finite limits for every peer-controlled HTTP and WebSocket buffer used
  by the public server path.
- Reject ambiguous HTTP framing and control characters in response status or
  header metadata.
- Added strict HTTP/3 pseudo-header, lowercase-name, connection-metadata,
  content-length, QPACK storage, request-body, response, and UDP packet bounds.
- Added sanitizer CI with leak detection across the connection slab,
  completion-driven teardown, compression engines, and C/C++ FFI boundaries.
- Added strict RFC 7692 negotiation and no-context-takeover so compressed state
  is never retained across application messages.
- Decline offers that require an 8-bit server compression window while
  accepting 8-bit client streams only through bounded decoding. Centralized
  regressions cover both branches.
- Added libFuzzer ABI coverage at the HTTP framing, WebSocket masking, and QUIC
  packet/varint trust boundaries.

### Breaking changes

- Route and WebSocket registration return errors and must be called with
  `try`, `catch`, or equivalent handling.
- Route registration returns `error.RoutesLocked` after `listen` or
  `listen_udp` succeeds.
- Applications that need messages larger than 16 KiB must use
  `ConfiguredApp` and set matching `WsBehavior` limits.
- Output can now return `error.WouldBlock`; WebSocket producers should resume
  from the `drain` callback.
- `WebSocket.send` rejects continuation opcodes because the public API emits
  complete final messages. `send_close` closes the transport after the close
  frame drains; use `terminate` for an immediate close.
- `http3_available` is now true. `init_http3` creates transport-isolated
  HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/3 TLS contexts, and HTTP/3 servers must call `listen_udp`
  before `run`.
- `WsBehavior` now exposes `.compression`; its default remains `.disabled`.
- Request route matching uses `Request.path`; the original request target and
  query are available separately as `Request.target` and `Request.query`.

### Known limitations

- HTTP/2 WebSocket extended CONNECT is not advertised. WebSocket upgrade,
  compression, and message state remain on the HTTP/1.1 connection path.
- The live HTTP/3 server handles bounded request/response streams and passes
  the curl/ngtcp2 and aioquic gate. RFC 9220 extended CONNECT, server push,
  and WebTransport are protocol helpers only because the pinned lsquic 4.9.3
  backend lacks the required current wire interfaces. TLS 0-RTT is rejected.
- `webtransport` implements draft-ietf-webtrans-http3-16 wire semantics and
  must not be presented as live WebTransport support. RFC 10008 is the separate
  HTTP `QUERY` method implemented by the router.
- C async tokens are event-loop-confined, generation-checked, and exactly once;
  middleware remains synchronous and fixed at 32 callbacks.
- RFC 7692 deliberately requires no-context-takeover and declines offers that
  require an 8-bit server compression window. An 8-bit client window remains
  supported for bounded decompression.
- Only POSIX targets are supported. The published matrix covers Linux and
  macOS; FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFlyBSD are accepted by the build
  but are not published artifacts. Windows is intentionally unsupported.
- The no-exclusion Autobahn run covers all 517 selected cases with 514 `OK`
  and 3 `INFORMATIONAL` results for both protocol and close behavior. The
  compliance gate passes groups 1-7 and 9-13, including compression.
