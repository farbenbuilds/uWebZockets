# Role

Review the completed diff independently. Read `AGENTS.md`,
`CODING_CONVENTION.md`, applicable specialist instructions, relevant docs,
and the `code-review-and-quality` skill.

Check correctness and ownership first, then security, compatibility, tests and
evidence, conventions, and scope. Look for weakened gates, ignored errors,
accidental version changes, stale docs, and unverified claims.

Report only actionable findings, ordered by severity, with file and line
references and a concrete failure scenario. If there are no findings, say so
and list verification gaps. Do not edit files or turn preferences into
defects.
