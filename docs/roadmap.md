# Roadmap and Boundaries

This page is the honest map of what µWebZockets does, what it deliberately does
not do, and why. It exists so a developer can decide whether a missing feature
is a defect, a scoped decision, or pending work.

## Closed in 1.7.0

| Boundary | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| No client API | Bounded HTTP/1.1 client over TCP and TLS with fixed slots, timeouts, and loopback tests ([client.md](client.md)) |
| No mutual TLS | `init_https_mtls` with `none` / `optional` / `required` verification against a caller CA bundle ([tls.md](tls.md#client-certificates-mtls)) |
| No auth or rate limiting | `middleware.Auth` (Basic/Bearer, constant-time) and `middleware.RateLimit` (fixed token buckets, rotation-resistant) ([http.md](http.md#middleware)) |
| No graceful shutdown helper | `App.catch_shutdown_signals()` and `Cluster.catch_shutdown_signals()` for SIGINT/SIGTERM and Windows console control |
| HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 were invisible in the dev log | One `http_request` record per completed exchange on both, plus HTTP/2 counter increments |
| Docs could drift | `scripts/check_docs.sh` validates every relative markdown link in CI |
| Stale supported-version policy | [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) tracks the latest released minor line |
| Monolithic protocol documentation | Split into [http.md](http.md), [http2.md](http2.md), [quic.md](quic.md), [websocket.md](websocket.md), and [json_rpc.md](json_rpc.md) |

## Deliberate boundaries

These are decisions, not omissions. Each has a reason and, where relevant, the
condition that would change it.

| Boundary | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| TLS 1.2 is not supported | TLS 1.3-only is a deliberate security posture; adding 1.2 would re-enable obsolete cipher suites for no functional gain |
| No dynamic capacity overflow | Fixed startup slabs are the architecture. Exhaustion returns a structured error; silently allocating would reintroduce heap behavior on the hot path |
| Request bodies are buffered, not streamed to handlers | Handlers are synchronous; true upload streaming needs an async body-reader contract. Response streaming already exists (`begin_stream`) |
| HTTP/2 server push is not implemented | Deprecated in practice and removed from lsquic upstream; no browser consumes it |
| h2c Upgrade is not implemented | RFC 9113 removed the Upgrade mechanism; cleartext HTTP/2 uses prior knowledge and TLS uses ALPN |
| HTTP/2 caps at 8 concurrent streams and one WebSocket tunnel per connection | Stream and tunnel storage is connection-owned and carved from the slab. Raising the defaults requires specializing the connection type |
| WebTransport is not live | The pinned lsquic build exposes raw datagrams but not extended CONNECT, server-initiated unidirectional streams, or reset-at; see [ADR 0001](adr/0001-http3-datagram-and-webtransport.md) |
| HTTP/3 does not advance the metrics registry | The engine has no registry handle without new plumbing through the transport; records are emitted instead |
| kTLS is a standalone helper, not an integrated offload | The pinned BoringSSL has no kernel-TLS support, so the connection path cannot hand keys to the kernel. `uz.ktls` remains available to applications that manage their own records |
| MemorySanitizer does not instrument Zig code | Zig 0.16 emits no MSan instrumentation. The MSan gate covers the pinned C/C++ dependency boundary |
| BSD targets have no runtime CI | No hosted GitHub runners exist for the BSDs; the shared build graph is compiled but not executed in CI |
| Windows runtime validation is blocked | Two defects block the first Windows accept loop; see [Windows runtime blocker details](#windows-runtime-blocker-details). The workflow stays compile-only until they are fixed |
| macOS workers are unpinned | The platform exposes no hard-affinity API |
| The client is HTTP/1.1 only | It is deliberately small: no DNS resolution (numeric addresses only), no redirects, no cookies, no proxy support, no connection pooling, no mTLS, and no HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 client |
| The C ABI is a high-level subset | Opaque handles and fixed capacities target C/C++ consumers; the low-level HTTP/2, HPACK, HTTP/3-extension, WebTransport, UDP, and client modules are Zig-only |
| Zig 0.16.0 is the only supported toolchain | It is the latest usable release without known breaking defects for this codebase. Pre-1.0 toolchains churn; pin the exact compiler |

## Windows runtime blocker details

A native Windows runtime gate was attempted on `windows-2025` and traced to two
defects, in order of encounter.

1. **libxev accept lifecycle (upstream).** After a successful `AcceptEx`, the
   IOCP backend returns the accepted socket from the completion but never
   clears `op.accept.internal_accept_socket`. A persistent accept loop re-arms
   the completion, and `start_completion` calls `AcceptEx` again with the
   already-connected socket, which returns `WSAEINVAL (10022)`; libxev then
   panics while mapping that unmapped Winsock code to `Win32Error`. A
   standalone probe confirmed the `AcceptEx` arguments are fine (a zero
   local-address length returns `WSA_IO_PENDING` on `windows-2025`), and a
   local patch that clears the field after taking the socket got the server
   past the panic. The minimal upstream fix is to null the field on both the
   success and error paths of the accept completion.
2. **Queued completions on the Windows close path (this project).** With the
   accept fix applied, `verify_shutdown` failed with `ShutdownIncomplete`
   because a connection stayed in the pool with `is_writing = true`.
   `Completion.state()` maps both `.adding` (queued, not yet submitted) and
   `.active` to `.active`, so the Windows close branch never clears
   `is_writing`/`read_active` for a completion that is canceled before
   submission. libxev marks the unsubmitted target `.dead` and fires only the
   cancel callback, so the write callback never runs and the slot is never
   released. The fix direction is to distinguish queued from submitted
   completions (submit them before canceling, or track submission explicitly)
   and clear the flags for completions whose callback will never fire.

The temporary probe branch was discarded; no dependency fork or vendored
libxev change is carried in this release. Revisiting Windows runtime support
starts from these two findings.

## Near-term direction

Candidates for the next minor releases, in rough dependency order:

1. **WebSocket client** over the existing client transport, using the zslay
   client role for framing and masking.
2. **Incremental request bodies** for HTTP/1.1: a bounded, async body reader
   that lets large uploads bypass `max_body_size` per connection.
3. **Configurable HTTP/2 stream and tunnel counts** through connection-type
   specialization.
4. **HTTP/3 counter parity** by threading the metrics registry into the engine.
5. **WebTransport activation** behind the capability gate recorded in
   [ADR 0001](adr/0001-http3-datagram-and-webtransport.md), once the pinned
   lsquic exposes the required server interfaces.
6. **kTLS integration** if BoringSSL gains a supported key-handoff API.

## How to influence the roadmap

Open an issue describing the use case, or a pull request following
[CONTRIBUTE.md](../CONTRIBUTE.md). The project accepts additive changes that
preserve bounded behavior; proposals that add unbounded allocation to the hot
path or weaken a compliance gate are declined by policy, not by preference.
