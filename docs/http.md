# HTTP/1.1, Routing, and Middleware

This document covers the HTTP/1.1 transport, the radix router, middleware, and
the allocation-free request/response helper layer. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 share the
same application boundary; see [http2.md](http2.md) and [quic.md](quic.md) for
their wire behavior.

## HTTP/1.1

The TCP connection accumulates a bounded request until the parser can prove it
is complete. The parser rejects conflicting or malformed framing, excessive
request lines, headers, and bodies, and unsupported expectations. Pipelined
bytes are retained and parsed again after a response completes. Responses
validate control-character injection and ambiguous `Content-Length` /
`Transfer-Encoding` before writing.

### Limits and rejections

| Input | Default | Configured by | Oversized result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Request line | 8 KiB | `with_max_request_line_size` | `431 Request Header Fields Too Large` |
| Header block | 16 KiB | `with_max_header_size` | `431 Request Header Fields Too Large` |
| Header count | 64 inline fields | `with_max_header_count` | Spills into per-connection slab storage, then `431` |
| Request body | 16 KiB | `with_max_body_size` | `413 Payload Too Large` |

Rejections carry the structured JSON documents described in
[memory_model.md](memory_model.md), so a client always learns which limit it
hit and by how much. `100 Continue` is handled automatically.

### Reading a request

```zig
fn search(req: *uz.Request, res: *uz.Response) void {
    // Register routes on the path only; the query string is already split off.
    const params = req.query_params() catch return;
    const page = (params.get_int(u32, "page") catch null) orelse 1;
    var scratch: [96]u8 = undefined;
    res.json_buf(.{ .query = params.get("q") orelse "", .page = page }, &scratch) catch {};
}
```

`Request` fields and route-parameter values borrow the connection's request
buffer. They stay valid through a synchronous callback or until an asynchronous
response completes; copy them into bounded application storage for longer work,
or use `Request.clone(allocator)` for an owned snapshot.

### Writing a response

Use the highest-level helper that fits:

| Need | API |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed text, HTML, or bytes | `res.text`, `res.html`, `res.bytes` |
| A comptime or bounded JSON value | `res.json`, `res.json_buf` |
| Arbitrarily large JSON without allocation | `res.begin_json()` |
| Chunked output you drive | `begin_chunked` / `write_chunk` / `end_chunks` |
| A body produced as the transport drains | `res.begin_stream()` |
| Server-Sent Events | `res.sse()` |
| A file from disk | `res.send_file()` or `App.static` |

`Response.begin_stream()` pulls chunks from an application callback only when
the write queue and flow-control windows have room, so response size never
depends on the queue size.

## Routing

Exact routes stay on the radix fast path. A `:name` segment captures one
nonempty path segment, and a terminal `*name` captures the remaining path
including an empty remainder. `Request.get_param` reads up to 16 borrowed
captures.

- Static routes win over parameter and wildcard matches.
- Malformed patterns, duplicate parameter names, and nonterminal wildcards fail
  registration instead of falling back to ambiguous matching.
- Registration is a startup activity. Route arrays are immutable once a
  listener starts, so callbacks never observe a structural mutation.
- `App.openapi(path)` serves a generated OpenAPI 3.1 document; parameter and
  wildcard paths are emitted with OpenAPI braces.

```zig
_ = try app.get("/", index);
_ = try app.get("/users/:id", show_user);
_ = try app.get("/assets/*path", serve_asset);
```

### Handler shapes

| Registration | Callback | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get` / `post` / ... | `fn (*Request, *Response) void` | Synchronous work |
| `route_context` | `fn (*anyopaque, *Request, *Response) void` | Explicit caller-owned state |
| `route_async` | `fn (*Request, AsyncResponse) void` | Work that finishes later |
| context variants | `fn (*anyopaque, *Request, AsyncResponse) void` | Deferred work with state |

Asynchronous tokens are generation-checked and complete exactly once. A pending
token keeps the TCP request buffer or HTTP/3 stream from being reused. Complete
the token on the owning event loop; marshal cross-thread results back to it
first.

## Middleware

`App.use` appends at most 32 global middleware callbacks. They run in order and
stop when they return `.stop` or start a response.

```zig
var headers = uz.middleware.security_headers(.{});
_ = try app.use(&headers, uz.middleware.SecurityHeaders.handler);

var cors = uz.middleware.cors(.{ .origins = &.{"https://example.com"} });
_ = try app.use(&cors, uz.middleware.Cors.handler);
```

### Authentication

`Auth` validates the unique `Authorization` field against caller-owned Basic
and Bearer credential lists. It decodes Basic into a bounded stack buffer,
compares in constant time, and answers missing, duplicate, or invalid
credentials with `401 Unauthorized` plus a challenge listing only the
configured schemes.

```zig
var credentials = uz.middleware.auth(.{
    .realm = "ops",
    .basic = &.{.{ .username = "admin", .password = "secret" }},
    .bearer = &.{.{ .token = "service-token" }},
});
_ = try app.use(&credentials, uz.middleware.Auth.handler);
```

### Rate limiting

`RateLimit` charges caller-owned token buckets keyed by a custom function, an
FNV-1a hash of a configured header, or a constant. Buckets refill continuously
from the monotonic clock; an empty bucket receives `429 Too Many Requests` and
`Retry-After`. A full bucket table evicts the oldest entry and starts the
evicted key empty, so rotating a key cannot reset a budget.

```zig
var buckets: [256]uz.middleware.RateLimitBucket = @splat(.{});
var limiter = uz.middleware.rate_limit(io, .{
    .rate_per_second = 20,
    .burst = 40,
    .key_header = "x-api-key", // server-derived values only
}, &buckets);
_ = try app.use(&limiter, uz.middleware.RateLimit.handler);
```

Both middleware types are allocation-free. One bucket table belongs to one
event loop; create one per cluster worker. Prefer `key_fn` or `key_constant`
when the key header can be set by the client.

## Static files

`App.static(prefix, root, options)` mounts a directory with directory-relative
path confinement, symlinks disabled, MIME detection, ETag and Last-Modified
validation, cache control, and one RFC 9110 byte range. Plaintext `GET` and
`HEAD` responses stream the file with the kernel `sendfile` boundary
(`Response.send_file`), so assets are not capped by the per-route file buffer.
TLS, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 remain on the bounded buffered path.

## Request and response helpers

Framework modules expose zero-allocation query/form parsing with SIMD slicing
and compile-time capacities, streaming chunked JSON (`Response.begin_json`),
drain-driven producer bodies (`Response.begin_stream`), multipart iteration,
HMAC-SHA256 signed cookies with rotating keys and HTTP-date `Expires`, comptime
JSON field constraints with typed parse issues, canonical status lines, typed
JSON error documents, `Accept` negotiation, ETag and conditional-GET helpers,
CORS and security-header middleware, and SSE.

Every helper reuses the existing bounded buffers and stays off the heap on the
request path. For the full helper inventory, see [api.md](api.md).

## Integration with another parser

Integration code may attach borrowed `extra_param_*` or `extra_header_*` slices
when adapting a different parser. The built-in parsers do not populate them or
expand their fixed capacities dynamically.
