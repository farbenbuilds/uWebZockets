# Application API Guide

This is the practical guide to the µWebZockets application surface. It is the
map; each linked protocol document has the wire-level detail.

- [http.md](http.md) — HTTP/1.1 parsing, routing, middleware, helpers, static files
- [http2.md](http2.md) — HTTP/2, HPACK, RFC 8441 tunnels
- [quic.md](quic.md) — HTTP/3, QPACK, WebTransport status
- [websocket.md](websocket.md) — RFC 6455, compression, pub/sub
- [json_rpc.md](json_rpc.md) — JSON-RPC 2.0
- [client.md](client.md) — outbound HTTP/1.1 client
- [memory_model.md](memory_model.md) — capacities, slab layout, backpressure
- [deployment.md](deployment.md) — production checklist

## Application types

| Type | Connections | Message size | Write queue | Idle timeout |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `App(N)` | `N` | 16 KiB | 16 KiB | 120 s |
| `ConfiguredApp(N, message, queue)` | `N` | compile-time | compile-time | 120 s |
| `ConfiguredAppWithTimeout(N, message, queue, timeout_ms)` | `N` | compile-time | compile-time | compile-time |
| `Server.builder(io)` | runtime config | runtime config | runtime config | runtime config |

`App(N)` is the shortest path. `Server.builder` is the fluent path for runtime
configuration and presets:

```zig
var server = try uz.Server.builder(init.io)
    .preset(uz.Presets.microservice)
    .with_max_body_size(256 * 1024)
    .build(std.heap.page_allocator);
defer server.deinit();
```

`build` performs exactly one application allocation: the contiguous slab behind
the pool, request buffers, message regions, write queues, router storage, and
optional compression scratch. `ServerConfig` presets are listed in
[memory_model.md](memory_model.md).

## Lifecycle

```zig
var app = try uz.App(128).init(init.io);   // one allocation
defer app.deinit();                        // drains, then releases the slab

_ = try app.get("/", hello);
try app.listen("0.0.0.0", 3000);           // locks route registration
try app.run();                             // blocks until shutdown drains
```

| Step | Rules |
| --- | --- |
| `init*` | Choose plaintext, HTTPS, mTLS, or HTTP/3; HTTPS variants load credentials before the loop starts |
| Route registration | Before the first `listen`; later calls return `error.RoutesLocked` |
| `listen` / `listen_udp` | Bind and start accepting; the `App` must stay at a stable address |
| `run` | Drives the loop until shutdown completes; `error.ApplicationAlreadyRunning` if re-entered |
| `shutdown` | Safe from another thread or a callback; drains completions before returning |
| `deinit` | Panics if called from inside the event loop; always pair with `defer` |

### Graceful shutdown signals

```zig
try app.catch_shutdown_signals();
try app.run();
```

`catch_shutdown_signals` installs a process-wide SIGINT/SIGTERM watcher (a
Windows console-control handler on Windows) that requests the same shutdown
path as `shutdown`. Install it once per process. Cluster applications use
`Cluster.catch_shutdown_signals()`, which requests shutdown for every worker.
The watcher is allocation-free and coalesces repeated signals.

## Routing and handlers

```zig
_ = try app.get("/users/:id", show_user);
_ = try app.post("/users", create_user);
_ = try app.query("/search", search);        // RFC 10008 QUERY
_ = try app.any("/health", health);
```

| Registration | Callback signature | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get` / `head` / `post` / `put` / `delete` / `patch` / `options` / `query` / `any` | `fn (*Request, *Response) void` | Synchronous work |
| `route_context` / `get_context` | `fn (*anyopaque, *Request, *Response) void` | Explicit caller-owned state |
| `route_async` / `get_async` | `fn (*Request, AsyncResponse) void` | Work completed later |
| `route_async_context` / `get_async_context` | `fn (*anyopaque, *Request, AsyncResponse) void` | Deferred work with state |

Path patterns: exact segments stay on the radix fast path, `:name` captures one
nonempty segment, and a terminal `*name` captures the remainder. Static routes
win. Malformed patterns fail registration rather than matching ambiguously.

## Middleware

`App.use(context, handler)` appends at most 32 global middleware callbacks; they
run in registration order and stop on `.stop` or a started response. Built-in
middleware: `Cors`, `SecurityHeaders`, `Auth`, and `RateLimit`. See
[http.md](http.md#middleware).

## Request

| Group | API |
| --- | --- |
| Target | `req.method`, `req.target`, `req.path`, `req.query`, `req.url()` |
| Headers | `req.headers()`, `req.get_header`, `req.get_unique_header`, `req.header_has_token` |
| Body | `req.text()`, `req.bytes()`, `req.json(T, allocator)`, `req.body` |
| Route captures | `req.get_param`, up to 16 borrowed captures |
| Query and form | `req.query_params()`, `req.query_params_of(N)`, `req.form()` |
| Ownership | `req.clone(allocator)` returns an `OwnedRequest` for deferred work |

## Response

| Group | API |
| --- | --- |
| Simple bodies | `res.text`, `res.html`, `res.bytes`, `res.json`, `res.json_buf` |
| Streaming JSON | `res.begin_json()` |
| Chunked output | `begin_chunked`, `write_chunk`, `end_chunks` |
| Drain-driven bodies | `res.begin_stream()` with a `StreamProducer` |
| Files | `res.send_file()`, `App.static` |
| Server-Sent Events | `res.sse()` |
| Redirects and headers | `res.redirect`, `res.append_header`, `end_with_headers` |

## Asynchronous responses

An async token is copyable, generation-checked, and completes exactly once:

```zig
fn deferred(_: *uz.Request, token: uz.AsyncResponse) void {
    // Hand the token to a worker or timer, then complete it on this loop.
    token.complete("200 OK", "later") catch {};
}
```

A pending token keeps the request buffer or HTTP/3 stream from being reused.
Complete it on the owning event loop; marshal cross-thread results back to that
loop before completing.

## WebSocket, static files, RPC, OpenAPI

```zig
_ = try app.ws("/chat", .{ .open = on_open, .message = on_message, .close = on_close });
_ = try app.static("/assets", "public", .{});
_ = try app.rpc("/rpc", &service);
_ = try app.openapi("/openapi.json");
```

## Cluster

`App.cluster(worker_count)` returns a heap-backed thread-per-core manager.
Configure routes per worker, `listen` once, and `run` joins every worker.
`Cluster.publish` broadcasts through bounded per-worker rings, and
`Cluster.request_shutdown` drains all workers. See
[architecture.md](architecture.md).

## Observability

```zig
var server = try uz.Server.builder(init.io)
    .with_observability(true)
    .with_dev_log(true)
    .build(std.heap.page_allocator);
```

- `with_dev_log(true)` prints a startup wordmark and per-request lines; stderr
  is only written when it is a terminal unless `set_dev_log_file` binds a file.
- `App.log_metrics()` records every counter of the bounded Prometheus registry.
- `uwz_connections_accepted`, `uwz_connections_closed`, `uwz_http_requests`,
  and `uwz_ws_messages` advance for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. HTTP/3 emits request
  records but does not advance the counter registry yet.

## Ownership and lifetime rules

| Value | Valid until |
| --- | --- |
| `Request` fields, route captures | Synchronous handler return, or async token completion |
| WebSocket `message` slice | Callback return |
| `ResponseView` from the client | Callback return, or `FetchStorage` lifetime |
| `AsyncResponse` token | Completed exactly once; copyable |
| `App` value | Must not move after `listen` or `listen_udp` |

Slices always borrow connection storage. Copy into bounded application storage
or use `clone` for work that outlives the callback.

## Error handling

Framework methods return Zig error sets; route handlers report failures through
the `Response`. Capacity exhaustion is explicit: `413` for oversized bodies,
`431` for oversized headers, `503` for exhausted WebSocket tunnel or capacity
limits, and `error.WouldBlock` from WebSocket `send`. Structured JSON rejection
bodies name the limit and its value. See
[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md).

## C and C++ consumers

`zig build lib` installs `zig-out/include/uWebZockets.h` with versioned opaque
handles, `uwz_slice` views, and a versioned error mapping. The C ABI is a
high-level server ABI: the low-level `udp`, HTTP/2, HPACK, HTTP/3-extension,
WebTransport, and client modules are Zig-only. See
[operations.md](operations.md#c-abi).
